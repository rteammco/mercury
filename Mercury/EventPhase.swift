//  An EventPhase is a series of events and conditioned actions that can be executed as a single phase of a level (managed by a GameScene). Phases can be chained, allowing for a complex series of changing event-driven mechanics.

  // The next phase. If this is set (with setNextPhase), it will be started after this phase is finished.
