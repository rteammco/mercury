//  A list of keys that are used for the GameState. All keys used in the global GameState are defined here. Keys are grouped and named according to the type of action they represent.
//
//  The keys are enumerated as strings to allow referencing the actual raw string value (the string of the enum variable name) so that keys can be processed using standard string methods.


enum GameStateKey: String {
  
  // Screen and user interaction events:
  case screenTouchDown, screenTouchMoved, screenTouchUp, pauseGame, resumeGame
  
  // Object spawning events:
  case spawnPlayerBullet, spawnEnemy, spawnEnemyBullet, createParticleEffect
  
  // Object dying events:
  case enemyDied, playerDied
  
  // Tracked player variables:
  case playerPosition, playerPositionXScaling, playerHealth, playerHealthChange, playerStatus, playerExperienceChange, playerLeveledUp
  
  // Tracked enemy variables:
  case numSpawnedEnemies
  
  // Game balance and damage exchange variables.
