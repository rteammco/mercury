//  The Event system provides a standard interface for events to trigger when a condition is satisfied. The Event system provides event chaining, looping, and a standard way of implementing event calls. This event system in part provides high readability in the way event calls are organized.


// An EventCaller is a protocol for any object that can start an event.
// Standard implementation:
//   func when(_ event: Event) -> Event {
//     event.setCaller(this)
//     event.start()
//     return event
//   }
//   func execute(action: EventAction) {
//     action.setCaller(to: self)
//     action.execute()
//   }
protocol EventCaller {
  func when(_ event: Event) -> Event
  func execute(action: EventAction)
}


// An Event object triggers after some condition is satisfied. It can also take the form of an EventStopCriteria, allowing it to act as a stop condition for other events.
// Example event call (in an object implemeting the EventCaller protocol):
//   when(TimerEvent(seconds: 10)).execute(DisplayText(message: "Hello, world"))
class Event: EventStopCriteria, GameStateListener {
  
  // Actions to be executed any time the event triggers.
  var eventActions: [EventAction]
  
  // Actions and event (both optional) to be executed and started when event is completely done, and stops repeating.
  var eventFinishedActions: [EventAction]
  var nextEvent: Event?
  
  // Actions that are executed when the event chain is completed. These are not necessarily executed when this particular event is finished, since they can be passed down to the next event in the chain.
  var eventChainFinalActions: [EventAction]
  
  var caller: GameScene?
  var stopCriteria: EventStopCriteria?
  
  var wasTriggered: Bool
  
  // An inactive event cannot be triggered. Use stop() to inactivate.
  var isActive: Bool
  
  // Once this event is subscribed to GameState changes, this flag is flipped to true. This way, if the event is reset, it will not re-subscribe itself to those state changes again.
  var isSubscribedToGameStateChanges: Bool

  // This is just for readability, so you can execute an event that does nothing when it triggers. This can be useful for event chaining. For example, you could set up a timer that just waits for a few seconds before the next event kicks in:
  // when(TimerFires(afterSeconds: 5)).doNothing().then(when: EnemyDies()).execute(action: ...)
  @discardableResult func doNothing() -> Event {
