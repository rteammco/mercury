//  The Event system provides a standard interface for events to trigger when a condition is satisfied. The Event system provides event chaining, looping, and a standard way of implementing event calls. This event system in part provides high readability in the way event calls are organized.


// An EventCaller is a protocol for any object that can start an event.
// Standard implementation:
//   func when(_ event: Event) -> Event {
//     event.setCaller(this)
//     event.start()
//     return event
//   }
protocol EventCaller {
  func when(_ event: Event) -> Event
}


// An Event object triggers after some condition is satisfied. It can also take the form of an EventStopCriteria, allowing it to act as a stop condition for other events.
// Example event call (in an object implemeting the EventCaller protocol):
//   when(TimerEvent(seconds: 10)).execute(DisplayTextAction(message: "Hello, world"))
class Event: EventStopCriteria {
  
  var eventActions: [EventAction]

    self.caller = caller
  }
  
  // A single action to be performed when this event is triggered.

    if let caller = self.caller {

  // After triggering, this event will reset and restart repeatedly until the given criteria is met.
