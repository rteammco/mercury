//  A loot item is an object that drops from enemies or random sources and moves towards the player or waits for the player to come to it. Once it collides with the player, it will reward the player with the contents (e.g. experience, items, etc.).

  // A utility enum for other objects to organize loot items by type.
  enum ItemType {
    case experienceOrb

  // Creates a loot orb object with the given properties. Certain items that take the appearance of a loot orb should use this method to build it.
  // This method handles initializing phyiscs and setting the scene node. To apply, use the following createGameSceneNode code in the orb object (as an example):
  // override func createGameSceneNode(scale: CGFloat) -> SKNode {
  //   return createLootOrb(ofRadius: scale * 0.05, withColor: SKColor.red, withAnimationFile: "LootOrbHealth.sks")
  // }

    }

  // This update forces this item to never increase its distance from the player. This prevents items moving towards the player using a gravitational force from "overshooting" and moving out of orbit.
