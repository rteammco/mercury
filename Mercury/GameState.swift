//  The GameState object acts as an in-memory database that can track all variables about the game's state. Objects such as the GameScene or GameObjects can utilize this to keep all game state variables (such as player health, number of enemies, score, and literally any other information) in one global place. This can be useful for quickly saving and restoring the game state. It's primary purpose, however, is to allow Events and other GameStateListener objects to subscribe themselves as listeners to specific variables. Whenever these variables are updated, all listeners subscribed to that variable will be notified of the change.

class GameState {
  
  // Maps GameState variables (identified by a String key) to whatever value they are given.
  var gameStateValues: [String: Any]
  
  // Maps variables (identified by their key) to a set of GameStateListeners which have subscribed to getting reports on changes for those variables.
  var gameStateListeners: [String: [GameStateListener]]
  
  init() {
    self.gameStateValues = [String: Any]()
    self.gameStateListeners = [String: [GameStateListener]]()
  }
  
  // Set a value for the GameState. If the value did not exist before, it will be modified.
  // Example: gameState.set("player health", to: 100)
  func set(_ key: String, to value: Any) {
    self.gameStateValues[key] = value
    if let listeners = self.gameStateListeners[key] {
      for listener in listeners {
        listener.reportStateChange(key: key, value: value)
      }
    }
  }
  
  // Subscribes a GameStateListener to listen to the state variable identified by the given key. Whenever this state variable is updated, the listener will be notified via the reportStateChange method.
  func subscribe(listener: GameStateListener, to key: String) {
    if var listeners = self.gameStateListeners[key] {
      listeners.append(listener)
    } else {
      self.gameStateListeners[key] = [listener]
    }
  }
}
