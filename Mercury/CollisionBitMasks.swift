//  A list of physics collision bitmasks used by the physics engine to detect collision events. Each bitmask is associated with a particular category of object.
//  The physics ContactDelegate detects contact between scene nodes that define the appropriate contact bitmasks.
//  For example, a node's category can be set as "friendly" and its collision test categories can set to "enemy" and "environment". This means the physics engine will determine collisions between our node and any other node whose category is either "enemy" or "environment". Furthermore, any other node that has "friendly" as one of its collision test categories will be able to collide with this node as well.

  // "friendly" is absolute in terms of the player. "enemy" is for all enemies of the player.
